# SpaceDocker

## Dezhi Fang

SpaceDocker is a game where you control a spacecraft to dock with a space station.

What's special in this game is that you can't move your spacecraft
-- you can only accelerate it in four directions.
You can only "decelerate" by accelerating in the opposite direction.

Use arrow keys to accelerate in four directions,
keep L pressed to enable "precision" mode (accelerate less),
or keep L pressed to use "ruse" mode (accelerate more).

Don't run the spacecraft out of screen, or crash into the station.
Also don't run out of fuel!
Keep in mind moving does not cost you fuel, only "accelerating" does.

To "dock" with the station, connect the "one dot" connector
to the "two dot" docking port on the station.
